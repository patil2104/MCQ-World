    Cache memory
    RAM
    ROM
    None of the above

Answer: (a) Cache memory

Description: Cache memory is a high-speed memory, which is small in size but faster than the main memory (RAM). The CPU can access it more quickly than the primary memory. So, it is used to synchronize with a high-speed CPU and to improve its performance.

8) Computer address bus is -

    Multidirectional
    Bidirectional
    Unidirectional
    None of the above

Answer: (c) Unidirectional

Description: Address Bus carries the address of data (but not the data) between the processor and the memory. Address bus is 16-bit which can address up to 64 kb. Address bus is unidirectional.

9) Which of the following circuit is used to store one bit of data?

    Flip Flop
    Decoder
    Encoder
    Register

Answer: (a) Flip Flop

Description: Flip-flop is a digital memory circuit, and with the help of the flip-flop, we can store one bit of information. The fundamental blocks of various sequential circuits are flip-flops. Flip-flop is also called a bistable multivibrator or one-bit or binary.

10) Which of the following is a way in which the components of a computer are connected to each other?

    Computer parts
    Computer architecture
    Computer hardware
    None of the above

Answer: (b) Computer architecture

Description: Computer Architecture is concerned with the way hardware components are connected together to form a computer system. It acts as the interface between hardware and software.

11) Which of the following circuit convert the binary data into a decimal?

    Decoder
    Encoder
    Code converter
    Multiplexer

Answer: (c) Code converter

Description: None

12) The address in the main memory is known as -

    Logical address
    Physical address
    Memory address
    None of the above

Answer: (b) Physical address

Description: Physical address space in a system can be defined as the size of the main memory. It is really important to compare the process size with the physical address space. The process size must be less than the physical address space.

13) Subtraction in computers is carried out by -

    1's complement
    2's complement
    3's complement
    9's complement

Answer: (b) 2's complement

Description: 2's complement is used for representing signed numbers and performing arithmetic operations such as subtraction, addition, etc.

14) Which of the following computer bus connects the CPU to a memory on the system board?

    Expansion bus
    Width bus
    System bus
    None of the above

Answer: (c) System bus

Description: A system bus is a single bus that connects the major components of the computer system.

15) Which of the following memory unit communicates directly with the CPU?

    Auxiliary memory
    Main memory
    Secondary memory
    None of the above

Answer: (b) Main memory

Description: The main memory acts as the central storage unit in a computer system. Main memory is the memory unit that directly communicates with the CPU. It is a relatively large and fast memory that is used to store programs and data during runtime operations.

16) The collection of 8-bits is called as -

    Byte
    Nibble
